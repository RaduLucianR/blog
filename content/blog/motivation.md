The main motivation for this blog is to have a reference to my thoughts and opinions throughout time, as I noticed it's very hard for me to remember all the things that I believed 5-10 years ago. I think it's a necessity to ask other people's opinion about your ideas, and one of them should be you, you from X years ago. You are a different person now, after so long, but still share a lot in common with past-you.

Moreover, this is a place for me to practice writing - in general. I learnt how to write 16 years ago (really emphasizes how fast we approach the end, doesn't it?), and I've been writing ever since, but I can't say I have the confidence to write a story or an article. Rather shocking after 12 years of pre-Universitary education, let alone the next 5. Even though they taught us some rules, some guidelines, some formats, that's not exactly teaching somebody how to write a story. I want to practice and to be forced to practice to write.

Lastly, I want to practice writing in different languages - in particular. As of now (May 2024), I speak fluently only two languages - the obvious and my native Romanian. Two other languages are at the eh stage: Dutch and Spanish. I studied both for too long and still am not fluent in either. It occurred to me that in contrast with English, to which I dedicated 12 years of studying (again, really puts into perspective the inevitable) and writing of various pieces, I haven't really written or even try to write in the other two languages. At least not something longer than a paragraph. This is a really important issue with my language learning which I must address, and this will be the place to fix it.
