# Welcome!

Hi there, this is my blog. Here you can (more precisely *will*) find my research/thoughts about things.
You can find my motivation for this blog in [my first blog post](https://brunescu.com/motivation).

I am a Master student of Embedded Systems, now with a significant part of my experience in robotics, namely [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). Find out more about me on [my website](https://rlradulescu.com).
